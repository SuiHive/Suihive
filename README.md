## What is SuiHIVE
SuiHIVE is a crowdfunding platform built to facilitate open-source funding for developing projects on Sui blockchain. Here, programmers and developers of open-source software can develop their projects. Additionally, developers can submit their project ideas to the SuiHIVE platform to crowdsource funds from the public.

The goal is to build a platform where codes and developers can meet investors with similar interests. It helps to build a community of developers and users around open-source projects, which can help to increase collaboration and innovation. It allows for direct communication between developers and users, which can help to improve the quality and direction of open-source projects.

## Why Sui Blockchain?
Through the Sui permissionless, PoS-powered Layer 1 blockchain, crowdfunding will become more decentralized, censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer, and dynamic.
According to the whitepaper, Sui blockchain supports smart contract functionality, which allows the creation of decentralized applications that can be used for various purposes, such as crowdfunding. It is built on a highly secure architecture, which makes it resistant to hacking and other malicious attacks.
